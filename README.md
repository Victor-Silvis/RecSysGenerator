# RecSysGenerator
A CTGAN based generator and arrival simulator, which can be used to extensively test the performance of recommender systems over multiple iterations with varying traffic loads. This system simulates the arrival of existing and new users, as well as their interaction (e.g. clicks, buys). By utilizing CTGAN realistic new users and items are generated, that all can have evolving user preferences over time. Traffic patterns are based upon real data and simulated using a MMPP approach. The goal of the system is to replicate a real life scenario to fully test the recommender system (determine potential biases, efficiency etc) in an offline environment. The system will export html reports at a certain interval to keep track of the recsys and simulation performance/history.
